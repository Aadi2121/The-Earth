        <p>Moons – also called planetary satellites – come in many shapes, sizes and types. They are generally solid bodies, and few have atmospheres. Most planetary moons probably formed out the discs of gas and dust circulating around the planets in the early solar system. Moons orbit planets, and dwarf planets. They also orbit asteroids.

As of March 25, 2025, there were more than 891 confirmed moons in our solar system:

421 officially recognized moons orbiting planets, including dwarf planet Pluto.
More than 470 confirmed moons orbiting other officially confirmed dwarf planets, asteroids and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). TNOs are objects in the solar system that have an orbit beyond Neptune. Saturn has two ocean moons – Enceladus and Titan. Both have subsurface oceans and Titan also has surface seas of lakes of ethane and methane. The chunks of ice and rock in Saturn's rings (and the particles in the rings of the other outer planets) are not considered moons, yet embedded in Saturn's rings are distinct moons or moonlets. These shepherd moons help keep the rings in line. Titan, the second largest in the solar system, is the only moon with a thick atmosphere.

    <p>Every moon discovered in the modern era gets a number first. For example, S/2009 S1 was the first satellite discovered at Saturn in 2009. The most significant moons get an official name. Most moons in our solar system are named for mythological characters from a wide variety of cultures. Newer moons discovered at Saturn, for example, are named for Norse mythology such as Bergelmir, a giant. Uranus is the exception. Uranus' moons are named for characters in William Shakespeare's plays with destinations such as Ophelia and Puck in orbit. Other Uranian moon names were chosen from Alexander Pope's poetry (Belinda and Ariel).</p>
